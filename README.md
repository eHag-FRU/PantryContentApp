# Pantry App

This application is to help keep a track of what is in a pantry, while simple, it is useful for my immediate family. My immediate family has a very deep pantry cuppoard that is hard to see and remember what is all inside.

The application will be hosted on a thin client and a QR code will be used to let family members scan and be taken to the link of the web application, which is hosted on the houses LAN.
