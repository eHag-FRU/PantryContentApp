# Pantry App

This application is to help keep a track of what is in a pantry, while simple, it is useful for my immediate family. My immediate family has a very deep pantry cuppoard that is hard to see and remember what is all inside.

The application will be hosted on a thin client and a QR code will be used to let family members scan and be taken to the link of the web application, which is hosted on the houses LAN.

NOTE: This uses the old auto route functionality that CodeIgniter 4.19 and below used. This was disabled starting in CodeIgniter 4.20. If security is an issue for running the application, feel free to branch and fix. (The app is being used on a small LAN in my immediate family's home and security was not a big issue for me due to the audience size)
